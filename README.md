# SQLProject

In this project, I used SQLite to analyze a database of music store data. 
The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. To understand the media in the store, the customers and employees, and the invoice information.
I've written SQL code to run SQL queries and visualize the data using Excel to answer business-related questions.

#Tools Used:

SQLit
Excel to visualze
